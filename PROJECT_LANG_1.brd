<description language="en">&lt;b&gt;Project language file 1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For: seanpm2001/Learn-Eagle
About:
I decided to make Eagle the main project language file
for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Eagle) as Eagle is
the language this project is dedicated to, because this
project is about learning the Eagle progrmaming language.
It only makes sense to Eagle the official language for
this project. It is getting its own project language file,
starting here.
